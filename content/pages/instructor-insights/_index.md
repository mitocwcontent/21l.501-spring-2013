Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _21L.501 The American Novel: Stranger and Stranger_ as it was taught by Dr. Wyn Kelley in Spring 2013.

The course covered American authors and focused on relating the appearance of strangers to different kinds of strangeness. These sophisticated novels collectively illustrated strange places with strange histories, people with strange narratives or backgrounds, and how these can be both strange and estranging at the same time. This course used numerous tools, including [Locast](https://www.media.mit.edu/wearables/lizzy/locust/index.html) and [Annotation Studio](http://www.annotationstudio.org/), along with writing assignments and presentations.
